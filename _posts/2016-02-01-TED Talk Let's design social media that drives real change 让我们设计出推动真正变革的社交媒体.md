excerpt: "昨天看了这个TED Talk ---- Let's design social media that drives real change given by Wael Ghonim，有很多想说的，不仅仅是因为他的话引发了我的很多共鸣，更多的是最近 Facebook、Weibo 等社交网络因为大陆和台湾的事情乌烟瘴气，两边的网民骂来骂去，更多的人不经思考被别人或被媒体煽动着鼓舞着，信誓旦旦，大义凛然。我只是希望当人们在网上发布某些话的时候，都能多些思考，而不是随波逐流，沦为被利用的工具。" # without setting this option, jekyll will take the first 160 words to be its  excerpt part.

TED Talk: [Let's design social media that drives real change](http://www.ted.com/talks/wael_ghonim_let_s_design_social_media_that_drives_real_change) given by Wael Ghonim ( *[Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wael_Ghonim) and [Twitter Page](https://twitter.com/Ghonim)* ).


昨天看了这个TED Talk，有很多想说的，不仅仅是因为他的话引发了我的很多共鸣，更多的是最近 Facebook、Weibo 等社交网络因为大陆和台湾的事情乌烟瘴气，两边的网民骂来骂去，更多的人不经思考被别人或被媒体煽动着鼓舞着，信誓旦旦，大义凛然。我只是希望当人们在网上发布某些话的时候，都能多些思考，而不是随波逐流，沦为被利用的工具。

对于 “一些国家” 来说，言论自由就像是一个脆弱的、被众人觊觎的悖论：一方面，人民的整体素质无法支撑言论自由带来的巨大冲击，很多人无法明白自己言论的自由意味着什么，无法理解自由的言论背后有着多大的力量，更加脆弱地、不堪一击地被各种势力牵着鼻子；另一方面，如果不给予言论的自由，人民有永远无法从痛苦、自我反省和自我认知中学习如何行使自己的权利。

Wael Ghonim 四五年前做过第一个 TED Talk --- --- [Inside the Egyptian revolution](https://www.ted.com/talks/wael_ghonim_inside_the_egyptian_revolution)。看完这个视频，再对比他现在的视频，可以看出他思想的转变，可以看出他思考的深入。想的更多，想得更远，想得更深，更彻底。这种理性的变化更好地诠释了 Internet Activist 并不是 Internet Mob。只可惜，总有一些人打着正义、卫道的旗号招摇撞骗，浑水和泥，生怕世界不能再乱一点。 Wael Ghonim 相信，当我们可以把文明礼仪和深思的对话还给互联网时，它将是人类互联、人道互联最强大的平台。 ( *Wael Ghonim believes that the Internet can be the most powerful platform for connecting humanity, if we can bring civility and thoughtful conversations back to it.* )

在此引用 Wael Ghonim [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ghonim) 主页的一句话：

> Success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts.       ------ Winston Churchill

成功不是最终，失败并不致命。重要的是坚持的勇气。        ------ 温斯顿·丘吉尔

> I once said, "If you want to liberate a society, all you need is the Internet." I was wrong.

我曾说过：“如果你要解放社会，你需要的只是互联网。” 我错了。



> I said those words back in 2011, when a Facebook page I anonymously created helped spark the Egyptian revolution. The Arab Spring revealed social media's greatest potential, but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings. The same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart. I would like to share my own experience in using social media for activism, and talk about some of the challenges I have personally faced and what we could do about them.

我说这番话的时候是2011年，那时我匿名创建了一个脸书主页，这个主页帮助点燃了埃及的革命。*阿拉伯之春* ( *详见[维基百科](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%98%BF%E6%8B%89%E4%BC%AF%E4%B9%8B%E6%98%A5)* ) 揭示了社交媒体的巨大潜力，同时也暴露了其最大的缺点。这个工具让我们团结起来推翻独裁者，可也同样最终把我们撕裂。我想分享我自己的将社交媒体用于行动主义 ( *activism: a doctrine or practice that emphasizes direct vigorous action especially in support of or opposition to one side of a controversial issue. see [Merriam Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/activism), 行为主义，激进主义* ) 的经验，并讨论一些我个人面对的挑战，以及我们能够做些什么。



> In the early 2000s, Arabs were flooding the web. Thirsty for knowledge, for opportunities, for connecting with the rest of the people around the globe, we escaped our frustrating political realities and lived a virtual, alternative life. Just like many of them, I was completely apolitical until 2009. At the time, when I logged into social media, I started seeing more and more Egyptians aspiring for political change in the country. It felt like I was not alone.

21世纪初期，阿拉伯人大批涌进互联网。我们渴望知识、渴望机遇、渴望连结这个世界上的其他人，我们逃离了令人沮丧的政治现状，活在虚拟的、用以替代现实的人生中。和他们中的很多人一样，我在2009年以前从来不关心政治。可在那时，我登入社交媒体，开始看到越来越多的埃及人渴望着这个国家政治变革。我感到自己并不孤独。



> In June 2010, Internet changed my life forever. While browsing Facebook, I saw a photo, a terrifying photo, of a tortured, dead body of a young Egyptian guy. His name was Khaled Said. Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian who was killed by police. I saw myself in his picture. I thought, "I could be Khaled."

2010年6月，互联网永远地改变了我的人生。在浏览脸书时，我看到了一张照片，一张可怕的照片 --- --- 一个被折磨过的埃及年轻人的尸体。他的名字是卡勒德·赛义德。29岁的亚历山大人卡勒德是被警察杀害的。在他的照片中，我看到了自己。我想：“我也可能是卡勒德。”



> I could not sleep that night, and I decided to do something. I anonymously created a Facebook page and called it "We are all Khaled Said." In just three days, the page had over 100,000 people, fellow Egyptians who shared the same concern. Whatever was happening had to stop.

那晚我无法入睡，我决定要做些事。我匿名创建了脸书页面并且称之为“*我们都是卡勒德·赛义德 ( [We are all Khaled Said](https://www.facebook.com/elshaheeed.co.uk) )* ”。3天内，这个主页的追随者超过了10万人，十万有着同样担忧的埃及人。无论如何，这些正在发生的事必须停止。



> I recruited my co-admin, Abdel Rahman Mansour. We worked together for hours and hours. We were crowdsourcing ideas from the people. We were engaging them. We were calling collectively for actions, and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know. The page became the most followed page in the Arab world. It had more fans than established media organizations and even top celebrities.

我招募了我的共同管理者，阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·曼苏尔 ( *Abdel Rahman Mansour, [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbdelRahman_Mansour)* )。我们一起工作，夜以继日。我们群策群力，让人们参与进来。我们组织集体行动，分享政府当局不愿让埃及人知道的事情。这个主页变成了阿拉伯世界最受欢迎的脸书主页。它的粉丝比一些媒体甚至比当红明星的粉丝还要多。



> On January 14, 2011, Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia after mounting protests against his regime. I saw a spark of hope. Egyptians on social media were wondering, "If Tunisia did it, why can't we?" I posted an event on Facebook and called it "A Revolution against Corruption, Injustice and Dictatorship." I posed a question to the 300,000 users of the page at the time: "Today is the 14th of January. The 25th of January is Police Day. It's a national holiday. If 100,000 of us take to the streets of Cairo, no one is going to stop us. I wonder if we could do it."

2011年1月14日，在大量的抗议人群反对他的政权之后，本·阿里逃离了突尼西亚。我看到了希望的火花。社交媒体上的埃及人想，“突尼西亚做到了，为什么我们不能呢？” 我在脸书上公布了一个活动 “*一场反对腐败、不公和独裁的革命 ( A Revolution against Corruption, Injustice and Dictatorship )* ”。我向30万的主页粉丝提出了一个问题：“今天是1月14日。1月25日是警察日，一个全国性的节日。如果我们有10万人走上开罗街头，没有人能够阻止我们。我不知道我们能不能做到。”



> In just a few days, the invitation reached over a million people, and over 100,000 people confirmed attendance. Social media was crucial for this campaign. It helped a decentralized movement arise. It made people realize that they were not alone. And it made it impossible for the regime to stop it. At the time, they didn't even understand it. And on January 25th, Egyptians flooded the streets of Cairo and other cities, calling for change, breaking the barrier of fear and announcing a new era.

仅仅在几天之内，这个邀请就送达到了超过1百万人，有超过10万人确认参加。社交媒体对这场运动至关重要。它帮助了一个去中心化社会运动崛起。它让人们意识到他们并不是孤单，并让政府无力阻挡。那时，政府甚至不懂那是社交媒体。1月25日，埃及人们涌上开罗和其它各个城市的街头，呼吁变革，冲破恐惧的栅栏，宣告新时代的到来。



> Then came the consequences. A few hours before the regime cut off the Internet and telecommunications, I was walking in a dark street in Cairo, around midnight. I had just tweeted, "Pray for Egypt. The government must be planning a massacre tomorrow."

后果还是出现了。在政府当局切断互联网和通讯的几个小时前，夜深人静，我走在开罗的一条黑暗的街道上。我刚发了一条推特，“*为埃及祈祷。政府肯定在计划着明天的一场大屠杀。( Pray for Egypt. The government must be planning a massacre tomorrow. )* ”



> I was hit hard on my head. I lost my balance and fell down, to find four armed men surrounding me. One covered my mouth and the others paralyzed me. I knew I was being kidnapped by state security.

我的头被重重击打。我失去平衡倒在地上，发现四个全副武装的男人围绕着我。一个捂住我的嘴巴，其余的让我失去行动能力。我知道自己被国家安全局绑架了。



> I found myself in a cell, handcuffed, blindfolded. I was terrified. So was my family, who started looking for me in hospitals, police stations and even morgues.

我发现自己在监狱里，带着手铐，蒙着眼睛。我很害怕。我的家人也很害怕，他们开始在医院、在警局、甚至是停尸房寻找我。



> After my disappearance, a few of my fellow colleagues who knew I was the admin of the page told the media about my connection with that page, and that I was likely arrested by state security. My colleagues at Google started a search campaign trying to find me, and the fellow protesters in the square demanded my release.

我消失后，那些知道我是脸书主页管理员的同事告诉了媒体我与那个主页的关联，并且我很有可能被国家安全局监禁了。我在谷歌的同事开始了搜寻行动，想要找到我的下落，并且有很多抗议者在广场呼吁我的释放。



> After 11 days of complete darkness, I was set free. And three days later, Mubarak was forced to step down. It was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life. It was a time of great hope. Egyptians lived a utopia for 18 days during the revolution. They all shared the belief that we could actually live together despite our differences, that Egypt after Mubarak would be for all.

在完全黑暗的11天后，我自由了。又过了3天，穆巴拉克被迫下台。那是我人生最激动、最精神振奋的时刻。 那是怀抱伟大希望的时刻。埃及人民曾活在18天革命的乌托邦中。他们共享同样的信仰 --- --- 我们本可以求同存异地生活在一起，穆巴拉克之后的埃及将是和平包容的国度。



> But unfortunately, the post-revolution events were like a punch in the gut. The euphoria faded, we failed to build consensus, and the political struggle led to intense polarization. Social media only amplified that state, by facilitating the spread of misinformation, rumors, echo chambers and hate speech. The environment was purely toxic. My online world became a battleground filled with trolls, lies, hate speech. I started to worry about the safety of my family. But of course, this wasn't just about me. The polarization reached its peak between the two main powers -- the army supporters and the Islamists. People in the center, like me, started feeling helpless. Both groups wanted you to side with them; you were either with them or against them. And on the 3rd of July 2013, the army ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president, after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation.

但不幸的是，后革命时代的事件就像胸口挨的重拳。欢快逐渐消失，可我们未能成功达成共识，政治斗争慢慢演变成了紧张的的两极分化。社交媒体只能放大言论，助长传播错误的信息、谣言，重复的口号和仇恨的言论。环境完全被毒害了。我的网络世界变成了充斥着轮番大声高唱的谎言和仇恨言论的战场。我开始担心家人的安危。 但显然，这并不只是针对我。两极分化在两个主要势力 --- 军队支持者和伊斯兰教主义者 --- 的对抗下到达了巅峰。站在中间的向我一样的人们开始感到无助。两个集团都希望你站在他们一边；你要么是伙伴，要么是敌人。2013年7月3日，在持续了三天的公众抗议，呼吁他下台之后，军队驱赶了埃及历史上第一个民主选举产生的总统。



> That day I made a very hard decision. I decided to go silent, completely silent. It was a moment of defeat. I stayed silent for more than two years, and I used the time to reflect on everything that happened, trying to understand why did it happen. It became clear to me that while it's true that polarization is primarily driven by our human behavior, social media shapes this behavior and magnifies its impact. Say you want to say something that is not based on a fact, pick a fight or ignore someone that you don't like. These are all natural human impulses, but because of technology, acting on these impulses is only one click away.

那天我做出了一个艰难的决定。我决定沉默，完全沉默。那是最为挫败的时刻。我沉默了两年之多，我花时间反思过去发生的一切，想要理解为什么这一切会发生。我逐渐理解到 --- 两极分化最初的确主要是由我们的人性驱使的，可社交媒体塑造了这个行为，并且放大了它的影响。比如说，你想要说一些并不是基于事实的话，挑起斗争或是忽略某个你讨厌的人。这都是人类天生的冲动，但因为科技，这些冲动真正的发酵只需要一个点击而已。



> In my view, there are five critical challenges facing today's social media.

我认为，今天的社交媒体面着5个严峻的挑战。



> First, we don't know how to deal with rumors. Rumors that confirm people's biases are now believed and spread among millions of people.

首先，我们不知道如何应对谣言。那些巩固助长了人们偏见的谣言，正被更多的人接受相信着，并向数百万人群传播。



> Second, we create our own echo chambers. We tend to only communicate with people that we agree with, and thanks to social media, we can mute, un-follow and block everybody else.

第二，我们建立了我们自己的回音室。我们往往趋向于只和那些与我们观点相同的人沟通，并且，感谢社交媒体，我们能够沉默，取消关注 和屏蔽其他人。



> Third, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs. All of us probably know that. It's as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars.

第三，线上讨论很快就会演变成愤怒的暴民。我们所有人可能都了解这些。这就如同我们忘记了屏幕后面的人是真实的人类而不是一堆外星人。



> Fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions. Because of the speed and brevity of social media, we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs. And once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet, and we are less motivated to change these views, even when new evidence arises.  

第四，改变自己的观点变得真的很困难。因为社交媒体快速和简短的特征，我们被迫很快跳到结论，在140个字中书写有关复杂全球时政的犀利观点。当我们这样做的时候，这些观点永远存在于互联网上，可我们缺少改变这些观点的动力，即便是在新证据出现的情况下。



> Fifth -- and in my point of view, this is the most critical -- today, our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements, posts over discussions, shallow comments over deep conversations. It's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other.

第五，在我看来，这是最最重要的。今天，我们的社交媒体经验被设计为利于传播而不容易参与，利于发布而不利于讨论，利于浅薄的观点而不是深度的讨论。就好像我们认同自己是来这里对着他人说教而不是与他人对话。



> I witnessed how these critical challenges contributed to an already polarized Egyptian society, but this is not just about Egypt. Polarization is on the rise in the whole world. We need to work hard on figuring out how technology could be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem.

我目睹了这些严峻挑战是如何影响一个已是两极分化的埃及社会的，但是，这并不只是关于埃及。两极化在全球范围内都在持续升温。我们需要努力思索科技如何成为解决方案的一部分，而不是麻烦的一部分。



> There's a lot of debate today on how to combat online harassment and fight trolls. This is so important. No one could argue against that. But we need to also think about how to design social media experiences that promote civility and reward thoughtfulness. I know for a fact if I write a post that is more sensational, more one-sided, sometimes angry and aggressive, I get to have more people see that post. I will get more attention.  

当今有很多争论，关于如何抵抗网络骚扰以及反对蓄意的攻击漫骂。这个是在是太重要了。没有人会反对。但我们也需要去思考如何设计社交媒体实际体验，来推动礼貌修养，回报深思熟虑。我知道一个事实，如果我写一个更加耸动，更加一边倒，甚至有时更加愤恨和激进的帖子，我会得到更多人关注着个帖子。我会吸引更多注意力。



> But what if we put more focus on quality? What is more important: the total number of readers of a post you write, or who are the people who have impact that read what you write? Couldn't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations, rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time? Or reward people for reading and responding to views that they disagree with? And also, make it socially acceptable that we change our minds, or probably even reward that? What if we have a matrix that says how many people changed their minds, and that becomes part of our social media experience? If I could track how many people are changing their minds, I'd probably write more thoughtfully, trying to do that, rather than appealing to the people who already agree with me and "liking" because I just confirmed their biases.

但是如果我更加关注质量呢？ 到底哪个更重要：你写的帖子的总阅读量，还是是谁在阅读你的帖子，那些有更大的影响力的人在阅读你写的帖子？ 我们为什么不能创造更大的动机，让人们参与对话，而非一直宣传观点？ 或是奖励人们阅读和评论那些他们不同意的观点？ 同时，让改变自己的观点变成社会所接纳的行为，或者可能的话，甚至奖励这样的行为？ 如果我们有一个模型矩阵，可以说明有多少人改变他们的观点，成为社交媒体体验的一部分？ 如果我能追踪多少人改变了想法，我可能会写得更认真仔细，试图更有说服力，而不是在那些和我观点相同的人那里获得“赞”，因为我只是在认同和巩固他们的偏见。



> We also need to think about effective crowdsourcing mechanisms, to fact-check widely spread online information, and reward people who take part in that. In essence, we need to rethink today's social media ecosystem and redesign its experiences to reward thoughtfulness, civility and mutual understanding.

我们也需要思考有效的众策机制，来查实广为传播的网络信息，奖励那些参与进来的人。从本质上讲，我们需要重新思考今天的社交媒体系统，重新设计它的体验来奖励深思、修养和互相了解。



> As a believer in the Internet, I teamed up with a few friends, started a new project, trying to find answers and explore possibilities. Our first product is a new media platform for conversations. We're hosting conversations that promote mutual understanding and hopefully change minds. We don't claim to have the answers, but we started experimenting with different discussions about very divisive issues, such as race, gun control, the refugee debate, relationship between Islam and terrorism. These are conversations that matter.

作为互联网的信徒，我和一些朋友合作开启了一个新项目 ( [Parlio](https://www.parlio.com/) )，试图寻找答案，并且探索多种可能性。我们的第一个产品是新的谈话性媒体平台。我们举办对谈活动来促进相互理解，并希望改变人们的看法。我们并不声称拥有答案，但我们开始试验关于争议问题的不同的谈话，比如种族、限制枪支、有关难民的争论、伊斯兰和恐怖主义之间的关系， 这些都是重要的对话。



> Today, at least one out of three people on the planet have access to the Internet. But part of this Internet is being held captive by the less noble aspects of our human behavior.

今天，这个星球上至少有三分之一的人能够连接上互联网。但是这个互联网的一部分被人类习性中不那么高尚的方面俘虏着。



> Five years ago, I said, "If you want to liberate society, all you need is the Internet."

五年前，我说：“如果你想要解放社会，你只需要拥有互联网。”



> Today, I believe if we want to liberate society, we first need to liberate the Internet.

今天，我相信，如果我们想要解放社会，我们首先要解放互联网。



> Thank you very much.

非常感谢。
